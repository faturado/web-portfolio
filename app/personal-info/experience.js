    "As a Junior Tech Admin intern, I was immersed in a variety of hands-on technical tasks that strengthened my foundational skills in IT infrastructure. I was responsible for laying out and organizing LAN cables across different office areas, ensuring a clean and efficient setup. This included cable punching, RJ45 crimping, and helping with patch panel arrangements, which taught me precision and proper network setup standards. I also assisted in troubleshooting basic network issues, such as identifying miswired or loose connections.\n\nIn addition to networking, I contributed to CCTV installationsâ€”positioning cameras, managing cables, and connecting them to DVR systems. I participated in configuring network devices like routers and access points under the supervision of our senior techs. These experiences not only enhanced my technical capabilities but also improved my problem-solving, teamwork, and adaptability in a real-world office setting. Overall, the internship provided practical exposure to core IT support and infrastructure tasks aligned with a junior tech role.",
